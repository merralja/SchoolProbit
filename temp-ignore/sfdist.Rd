\title{sfdist: A function to find the distances from a set 'a' of points,
to a set 'b' of points.}
\usage{
sfdist(a.sf, b.sf)
}
\arguments{
\item{a.sf}{A simple features dataset in NAD83 UTM Zone 17N, consisting of points}

\item{b.sf}{A simple features dataset in NAD83 UTM Zone 17N, consisting of points}
}
\value{
A column 'DIST' is added to a.sf, giving the distance from each of the points in a.sf to its nearest neighbour in b.sf, in metres
