#' sess7r: A package with a minimum example of package creation.
#'
#' This package is an exercise in package creation using
#' R studio. The package will hopefully include a sample
#' function and a sample dataset with their respective
#' documentation, though the last time I tried this it
#' screwed up miserably.
